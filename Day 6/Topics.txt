when multiple rules are being applied on the same element, which rule to apply.

inline > id > class > element

!important overrides any other rules

class - 10pt
id - 100pt 
inline - 1000pt

p.para - 11pt
p#para - 101pt

//Position elements

default is static or initial, which means element has not been positioned explicitly. appears
acc. to the flow of the document

relative - object will be positioned relative to the place where 
it'll be originally rendered on the document

absolute - object will positioned w.r.t the viewport.
it'll be taken out of the normal. other elements will take its place and it'll be displayed 
on top of other elements.

fixed - fixes itself at place and moves according to the viewport.

sticky - similar to fixed.

fixed used in portfolio for the nav.

parent and child relationship

if a parent has relative position, child with absoulute position will be positioned 
absolutely acc. to the parent boundaries.

but if parent is not relative then the child will be placed acc. to the viewport.

//z-index - changes the order of overlapping elements

first the 0 level elements are rendered, then the positioned elements are rendered on top.
