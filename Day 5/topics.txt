Event handling

different types of event - click on a button, type through keyboard

how to listen to an event and respond to an event

1. how to add an event -> whenever an event happens an event object is 
passed to the callback funtion present inside the event listener

2. how to remove an event listener

3. label for input tag and input tag

4. keyboard event when pressing a key

keydown -> keypress(actual registration happens in window) -> keyup

event.preventDefault() // prevents the default behavior

// we can add multiple events to a control in the document, focus and blur to an input field


//event capturing phase
parent event captured first then child then subchild

//event bubbling
event propagates from the subchild to the parent and the grandparent

//event.stopPropagation() stops the event bubbling functionality

default behaviour is event bubbling.

//event to inject the js script only after all the elements are loaded and dom is created by the browser.
otherwise we get an error. if we place our scripts in the head tag.
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function(){
    //place your entire js code in here. 
})

//load event vs DOMContentLoaded event

//form tag
//submit data to a server
//collect some user info
//send data from client side to backend.

//methods and action in form

using event listeners to fetch details from the form fields

adding breakpoints through the sources tab and watching the value of the elements

//adding validity checks on values provided in the fields

//adding custom messages for the user to point the error out while typping in the value itself.
